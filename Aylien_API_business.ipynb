Unfortunately, the supply of homes for sale did not keep up with the demand for ownership housing. Sales as a share of new listings were up dramatically compared to a year ago. This is a clear signal that competition between buyers increased substantially compared to last year, resulting in the average selling price reaching almost $1.2 million last month.\n",

Recent polling from Ipsos found that City of Toronto residents gave Council a failing grade on housing affordability and pointed to lack of supply as the major issue. This issue is not unique to Toronto. It persists throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe. If we don’t quickly see housing supply catch up to population growth, the economic development of our region will be hampered as people and businesses look elsewhere to live and invest,” said Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) President Paul Baron.\n",

      "Article content “The demand for ownership housing has picked up markedly in recent months. Many homebuyers have recalibrated their housing needs in the face of higher borrowing costs and are moving back into the market. In addition, strong rent growth and record population growth on the back of immigration has also supported increased home sales. The supply of listings hasn’t kept up with sales, so we have seen upward pressure on selling prices during the spring,” said TRREB Chief Market Analyst Jason Mercer. The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) composite benchmark was down by 6.9 per cent year-over-year in May 2023, but up by 3.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted monthly basis compared to April 2023. The average selling price, at $1,196,101, represented a small 1.2 per cent decline relative to May 2022. On a seasonally adjusted monthly basis, the average selling price was up by 3.5 per cent compared to April 2023.\n",

      "Article content TORONTO, June 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) housing market continued to improve from a sales perspective in May 2023. Unfortunately, the supply of homes for sale did not keep up with the demand for ownership housing. Sales as a share of new listings were up dramatically compared to a year ago. This is a clear signal that competition between buyers increased substantially compared to last year, resulting in the average selling price reaching almost $1.2 million last month.\n",

Recent polling from Ipsos found that City of Toronto residents gave Council a failing grade on housing affordability and pointed to lack of supply as the major issue. This issue is not unique to Toronto. It persists throughout the Greater Golden Horseshoe. If we don’t quickly see housing supply catch up to population growth, the economic development of our region will be hampered as people and businesses look elsewhere to live and invest,” said Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) President Paul Baron. GTA REALTORS® reported 9,012 sales through TRREB’s MLS® System in May 2023 – a 24.7 per cent increase compared to May 2022. Conversely, new listings were down by 18.7 per cent over the same period. On a month-over-month seasonally adjusted basis, sales were up by 5.2 per cent compared to April 2023.\n",

      "Article content “The demand for ownership housing has picked up markedly in recent months. Many homebuyers have recalibrated their housing needs in the face of higher borrowing costs and are moving back into the market. In addition, strong rent growth and record population growth on the back of immigration has also supported increased home sales. The supply of listings hasn’t kept up with sales, so we have seen upward pressure on selling prices during the spring,” said TRREB Chief Market Analyst Jason Mercer. The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) composite benchmark was down by 6.9 per cent year-over-year in May 2023, but up by 3.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted monthly basis compared to April 2023. The average selling price, at $1,196,101, represented a small 1.2 per cent decline relative to May 2022.

      "NKE jumped 3.0% to pace all of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA premarket gainers, putting them on track to snap a four-day losing streak. The athletic apparel giant's stock had actually dropped in nine of the past 10 sessions, to close Thursday at the lowest price since Dec. 20, 2022. It has lost 13.1% during the 10-day stretch, while the Dow has slipped 1.4% over the same time. During that losing stretch, Nike received a rare “sell” recommendation from Williams Trading's Sam Poser, who said the company's footwear has run “stale.” The stock's bounce Friday comes a day after Macy's Inc. M said it will bring Nike products back to certain stores and e-commerce operations in the fall, with plans to scale to additional stores in 2024.Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

      "Michael Novogratz, the founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital, believes the crypto space is lackadaisical right now due to low participation from institutional investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "During an interview with CNBC, the American investor said the market lacks enthusiasm as most of the recent activities in the space are coming from retail buyers while large-scale players are withdrawing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite frankly, crypto is lackadaisical, I’d say. There’s a constant bid from retail. We’re seeing it through all the platforms, and there’s not a lot of institutional excitement right now and so the dog days of summer started early in crypto. Does it make me thrilled? That’s just the reality,” Novogratz said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Enthusiasm From Institutional Investors\n",
      "\n",
      "Novogratz’s statement resounds a May 31 report from CoinShares on weekly crypto asset flows, which disclosed that digital asset investment products saw outflows of $39 million from institutional investors for the sixth consecutive week, totaling $272 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin has remained the focus of the outflows, with a total of $11 million, while Ethereum lost $5.9 million in outflows. Algorand, Litecoin, and Uniswap funds also saw outflows of $8 million, $500,000, and $200,000, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. led the flows, with Germany and Switzerland following closely behind. Altogether, 0.8% of assets under management left the crypto market last week.\n",

      "Adoption Still On the Rise\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the declining institutional adoption, Novogratz noted that “interesting” things are still happening in the crypto space. The Galaxy Digital CEO pointed out the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and China.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest Chinese social media app, WeChat, recently enabled Bitcoin price quote indexes in its search queries. The platform’s 1.3 billion users can now access the digital asset’s price quotes despite the current crypto ban in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Hong Kong now allows retail crypto trading through regulated exchanges. The Hong Kong Virtual Asset Consortium has approved the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap for listing to enable easy reviews and compliance from the exchanges.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a couple of things that happened today which are pretty interesting. WeChat just enabled Bitcoin and crypto trading on the biggest single platform in the world. That’s a pretty big deal. Hong Kong is officially allowing crypto trading for retail customers through regulated exchanges for the first time, and so we’re seeing Asian adoption,” Novogratz added.\n",

      "In recent weeks, executives of brokers and carriers have been delivering mixed messages about conditions in the commercial insurance market.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The long curve, the larger trend, is bending in a positive direction for buyers.” John Drummond, head of Broking, North America for WTW, wrote in the executive summary to the Insurance Marketplace Realities Report published by the global broker and advisory firm in late April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chubb Chief Executive Officer Evan Greenberg had a different take on the first-quarter commercial insurance environment. “North America P/C rate and price increases reaccelerated in the quarter,” Greenberg said on an earnings conference call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carrier Management asked RLI Corp. Chief Operating Officer Jen Klobnak to weigh in. Often reporting earnings ahead of most other carriers, Klobnak has been first to identify market trends in D&O and property market in recent quarters. And RLI demonstrates its skill in spotting market opportunities and problems with a 27-year string of consecutive full-year underwriting profits.\n",
      "\n",

      "“In the last couple of years, it’s been kind of a hard market across the board, and people got so excited. Everybody’s been able to make some progress on underwriting profit. It’s paid for some investments for people, which is great.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But we are in insurance, which means sometime it’s going to turn. No matter how much you try to improve, how you look at life—the softening of the market is a given in the insurance industry,” she stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "She reported that D&O has been softening. And workers compensation “has been fighting that for quite a while actually,” she said, noting that the comp market is changing a bit now “with the different states getting a little more aware of what’s going on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Auto is always a space [that’s] up and down.” Commercial auto insurers are seeing the same accident trends that personal auto carriers are experiencing. “And it’s just the classic competition coming in. They are aware that you can make an underwriting profit, but they have to buy their way into the market. So, that’s what they do, which softens everybody. And then you have to determine if you want to make a consistent underwriting profit so you can be there for your insured and your producers over time. You’ve got to decide how much you can give away. And in some cases there is a limit to that,” she told Carrier Management, echoing some remarks she made on a first-quarter earnings call about the trucking segment of the commercial auto space, in particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t understand why, but people don’t appreciate that 2020 was a lull,” she said on the earnings call, noting that trucking competitors incorporate that down-year for losses into their go-forward pricing. “But in reality, there are accidents every day,” she said, noting that more insurance markets are also entering the trucking space every day. “It’s frustrating because you’re going to have claims. So, you need to charge enough to cover that,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concluding her overall commercial insurance market assessment during the Carrier Management interview a few weeks later, she said, “I think people got so excited about it being hard across the board that now everybody’s going to be dramatic and disappointed about the fact that, yes, we’re going to have a soft market someday. And it is happening in a couple of spots. But then you can contrast that with the property market, which still remains very hard. So, we just have to get our insurance hat back on and say this is how it works and let’s manage the portfolio accordingly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked to share her observations on the reinsurance market, she referred to commentary she delivered about Jan. 1 renewals during a year-end earnings conference call. “It was painful, to say the least, in the fourth quarter as we were gearing up for 1/1,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the fourth-quarter call, Klobnak reported that the specialty insurer made some anticipatory moves on property—raising prices and honing terms and conditions, including loss-sharing features like coinsurance and deductibles—throughout 2022. But when asked directly about passing on a 40 percent jump in RLI’s reinsurance costs to customers, she described a measured approach. “As we look at our renewal process, we quote 30 days to 60 days out, so that we can help our insurers manage their business. They’ve got a lot of increased costs already. They’ve got increased employee costs,…transportation costs, all kinds of costs that are going up. We’re one component of their business. And we try to help manage their ability to stay in business by not taking too drastic of actions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In contrast, I would say, the reinsurance market acted a little more quickly on their change—on both attempted change in coverage as well as cost. And so, it’s difficult to turn on a dime and pass that along, nor is it really something you want to do when you’re trying to be very consistent in the primary market.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in Florida, RLI continues to individually underwrite each renewal, she reported during the January earnings call. “Yes, our costs have gone up. So, yes, we will increase costs to some extent. But we’re going to try to manage it over time so that our insureds can continue to be insured,” she said, noting that RLI’s broker partners are also accepting a little bit less commission “so that we’re able to provide that change in coverage and terms a little more gracefully to our insureds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The danger of [any] abrupt change is that the insurance marketplace actually decreases because people will attempt to buy less coverage or less limit. And once they start doing that, that’s never going to come back,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Picking up on that theme during the Carrier Management interview, Klobnak said, “It’s very difficult when people move too quickly. This is an industry that really moves somewhat slowly. You don’t take too much drastic action up or down usually. But that was a drastic change for 1/1. And it’s continued on, my understanding is, through the year,” she said, noting that RLI has some renewals through July.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re going to deal with it like we always do, which is to tell the RLI story. We tend to have fairly good results. And so we’re going to get our story out there: How are we different than our competitors?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Solidifying some of the strong partnerships RLI has built up with reinsurers over time, the COO said the company invests time to make sure reinsurers are getting the answers they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, RLI is ceding less to its reinsurers in 2023. Having increased property and casualty treaty retentions at 1/1 (some first-dollar and in the form of co-participation on the side of a treaty), Klobnak said the specialty insurer is likely to take similar actions as other treaties come up for renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve actually made a gross underwriting profit for 27 consecutive years,” in addition to a net underwriting profit, she said, supporting decisions to increase retentions. “We probably want to increase retention a little bit across the board to make sure that we’re balancing—because not every product makes an underwriting profit every year,” affirming that RLI will continue to look at opportunities to take more net in one way or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll continue to do that throughout this year. And if the reinsurance market continues to be hard, I think we’ll look at that again on 1/1 as well,” she said.\n",

      "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle  Wegmans Food Markets announced this week that the company will close its store in Natick, Massachusetts roughly five years after the store opened.\n",
      " Located within the Natick Mall , the market was an experimental store for the chain, as Wegmans' first multi-level grocery store within a shopping mall. The 134,000-square-foot store, which opened in April 2018, is among the largest in the Gates-based supermarket chain. The store initially opened and operated a Mexican restaurant, which closed in 2019.\n",
      "  According to a news release from Wegmans, the Natick store is set to close later this summer. A final date has not yet been set. The Natick store employs 365 people, including 142 full-time employees. They will all be offered jobs at other Wegmans stores, according to the company.\n",
      "  \"Making these decisions is never easy,\" Brien MacKendrick, the human resources director for Wegmans' New England division, said in a statement. \"However, we do it for the long-term benefit of our people, our customers and our communities. Unfortunately, with this non-traditional location, we are unable to attract enough customers for our business model to work.\"\n",
      "  Wegmans has five other stores in the greater Boston area - in Burlington, Chestnut Hill, Medford, Northborough and Westwood. The supermarket chain operates 110 stores throughout New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Virginia, North Carolina, Delaware and Washington. D.C.\n",

      "Trying to understand the office sector these days is difficult. Tenants aren’t sure what their ultimate business models in terms of where employees work will be. Therefore, they don’t know how much space they’ll need and want short-term leases to give them flexibility. Property owners and operators are understandably concerned that an important basis of their own businesses could disappear. Everything, other than the workers, are trying to figure out how to get employees to want a return to the office.\n",

      "Paper bags, 'paper' bottles  Walmart Inc. is opting for paper, not plastics, for its ecommerce operations.\n",
      " The Arkansas-based retail giant said in a June 1 news release that it will move from plastic to paper mailers and give customers ordering online for in-store pickup the ability to opt out of single-use plastic bags and instead bring their own bags.\n",
      "  Walmart said it expects the transition to paper mailers will eliminate 65 million plastic bags, or about 2,000 tons of plastics by the end of this fiscal year.\n",
      "  \"Customers have told us how excited they are about these enhancements to make it easier for them to make more sustainable choices that support the planet and the next generation,\" said Karisa Sprague, senior vice president of fulfillment network operations, in the release.\n",
      "  It's not just plastics in the crosshairs for Walmart. The company said it will decrease its use of cardboard by \"right-sizing\" the boxes used in shipping. Having a greater variety of box sizes will eliminate unused space in boxes, reducing the need for filler materials by 60 percent.\n",
      "  Customers can also opt to consolidate items into fewer boxes, reducing waste and the number of shipments.\n",
      "  Walmart is one of several major retailers involved in the Beyond the Bag Initiative with Closed Loop Partners to develop alternatives to standard retail bags. But it also was dropped from a listing of bag dropoff sites because two recent reports using trackers to follow the bags through the recycling process raised questions about whether those bags were actually recycled.\n",
      "  A paper (and plastic) bottle\n",
      "  The marketing for new packaging for Absolut Vodka is stressing it as a one-piece \"paper bottle.\" But the bottle — still in the iconic shape of glass Absolut bottles — is actually a combination of paper and plastic.\n",
      "  The bottle from The Paper Battle Co. (Paboco) is being sold at 22 Tesco markets in the United Kingdom for three months as a test case and is the \"first time such paper-based bottles will have been sold commercially in-store by a global spirits company,\" Absolut said in a news release\n",
      "  The spirits maker says the bottle also has an \"integrated barrier of recyclable plastic,\" but Paboco's own website is more specific. The bottle is made with 15 percent high density polyethylene.\n",
      "  Absolut and Paboco have tested a limited number of bottles at festivals. The two companies say the paper bottle can be dropped into existing recycling systems in Manchester, England, which will be the test market. Glass bottles are also recyclable, Absolut notes, but the paper and plastic bottles are eight times lighter and easier to carry.\n",

      "  The global company Deceuninck Group is based in Hooglede, Belgium, and the event marked Ambassador Arthur Régibeau's first visit to a U.S. operation for the company.\n",
