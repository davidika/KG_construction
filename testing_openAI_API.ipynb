The article is: Mayurbhanj: One person was killed, while two others sustained critical injuries when they were brutally attacked by a youth on suspicion of practising black magic on Sunday night.\\nThe incident has been reported from Kainal village in Jualibhanga panchayat under Morada police station limits in Odisha's Mayurbhanj district.\\n  The deceased has been identified as Gauri Tudu (70) and the injured as Kuni Tudu (42) and Kalicharan Tudu (47).\\n  According to reports, a youth named Durga Charan Tudu suddenly attacked the three while they were sitting in their home last night. Durga Charan Tudu allegedly attacked the three with a sharp weapon, which left septuagenarian Gauri Tudu dead on the spot, while two members of the family were severely injured and dropped unconscious. He bore a grudge against the Tudu family suspecting that they practised witchcraft and were responsible for several ills in the village.\\n  Soon after the gruesome incident, the three were rushed to the nearby community health center where doctors declared Gauri Tudu brought dead. Kuni Tudu and Kalicharan Tudu were shifted to the PRM Hospital in Baripada as their condition deteriorated. Currently, Kuni Tudu and Kalicharan Tudu are undergoing treatment in the hospital and their condition is said to be critical.\\n  On being informed, Morada police IIC Padmalochan Manigarahi and Chitrada outpost officer Niranjan Saren reached the spot with their teams. They sent Gauri's body for post-mortem and detained Durga Charan Tudu for interrogation. An investigation into the incident is underway.\"\n",

While some signs make it easy to recognize, such as cold feet and hands, others are less well known.\\nA British vascular surgeon, Alun Davies, reported five in an article on Everyday Mail\\n  Blood circulation: how can the skin help identify venous insufficiency?\\n  This specialist explains that the condition of the skin can be an indicator. If it is shiny and there is a feeling of tension, in the legs and feet, it can be a sign of poor blood circulation, because this change leads to skin breakdown. “ Although these symptoms do not seem alarming, the restriction of blood flow can be caused by blockages in the arteries, which can be fatal.” , explains Professor Alun Davies. He adds that the numbness caused by the pathology can be serious in itself: “ The tingling and pins and needles that accompany foot numbness can not only be uncomfortable, but can also cause balance issues and mask possible foot injuries. “\\n  Lack of hair on the legs, another sign of venous insufficiency\\n  When it comes to the legs, a lack of hair can also be a warning sign. Hair loss can be a result of lack of blood in these areas leading to death of hair follicles due to lack of nutrients. “ It's more noticeable in men, many of whom can see a line in their socks, with no hair.” , continued the specialist. This symptom must be fully reported to a health professional, as it may result in gangrene of the lower extremities, the consequence of which may be amputation.\\n  Poor blood circulation: this causes leg ulcers\\n  Non-healing wounds on the legs also indicate poor blood circulation. The vascular surgeon explained that these lesions are usually located on the inside of the leg, between the ankle and the knee. The skin is sometimes hard and discolored around. For some people, it's not painful, but it's important to take care of these ulcers quickly to prevent infection.\\n  Venous insufficiency can cause abdominal pain\\n  The doctor reminds us that poor blood circulation has consequences for the whole organism, and even for vital organs. Poor blood circulation can cause abdominal pain or diarrhea. “ Like all vital organs, the stomach needs oxygen-rich blood flow to function properly.” he says.\\n  Memory loss: an unrecognized symptom of venous insufficiency\\n  Often associated with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, memory loss can also indicate a blood circulation disorder. According to this specialist, the lack of blood in the brain can cause memory lapses.\\n  Venous insufficiency: what are the treatments?\\n  There are several methods to get rid of these symptoms. First, compression: this consists of wearing stockings or surrounding the legs with bands to promote venous return. When that's not enough, doctors may suggest surgery to remove the diseased veins. According to the French Cardiology Federation, 18 million people suffer from venous circulation problems..\\n    ###\\n    \""

While some signs make it easy to recognize, such as cold feet and hands, others are less well known.\\nA British vascular surgeon, Alun Davies, reported five in an article on Everyday Mail\\n  Blood circulation: how can the skin help identify venous insufficiency?\\n  This specialist explains that the condition of the skin can be an indicator. If it is shiny and there is a feeling of tension, in the legs and feet, it can be a sign of poor blood circulation, because this change leads to skin breakdown. “ Although these symptoms do not seem alarming, the restriction of blood flow can be caused by blockages in the arteries, which can be fatal.” , explains Professor Alun Davies. He adds that the numbness caused by the pathology can be serious in itself: “ The tingling and pins and needles that accompany foot numbness can not only be uncomfortable, but can also cause balance issues and mask possible foot injuries. “\\n  Lack of hair on the legs, another sign of venous insufficiency\\n  When it comes to the legs, a lack of hair can also be a warning sign. Hair loss can be a result of lack of blood in these areas leading to death of hair follicles due to lack of nutrients. “ It's more noticeable in men, many of whom can see a line in their socks, with no hair.” , continued the specialist. This symptom must be fully reported to a health professional, as it may result in gangrene of the lower extremities, the consequence of which may be amputation.\\n  Poor blood circulation: this causes leg ulcers\\n  Non-healing wounds on the legs also indicate poor blood circulation. The vascular surgeon explained that these lesions are usually located on the inside of the leg, between the ankle and the knee. The skin is sometimes hard and discolored around. For some people, it's not painful, but it's important to take care of these ulcers quickly to prevent infection.\\n  Venous insufficiency can cause abdominal pain\\n  The doctor reminds us that poor blood circulation has consequences for the whole organism, and even for vital organs. Poor blood circulation can cause abdominal pain or diarrhea. “ Like all vital organs, the stomach needs oxygen-rich blood flow to function properly.” he says.\\n  Memory loss: an unrecognized symptom of venous insufficiency\\n  Often associated with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, memory loss can also indicate a blood circulation disorder. According to this specialist, the lack of blood in the brain can cause memory lapses.\\n  Venous insufficiency: what are the treatments?\\n  There are several methods to get rid of these symptoms. First, compression: this consists of wearing stockings or surrounding the legs with bands to promote venous return. When that's not enough, doctors may suggest surgery to remove the diseased veins. According to the French Cardiology Federation, 18 million people suffer from venous circulation problems..\\n    ###\\n    \"]\n"

      "    The article is: Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder and valiant freedom fighter Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury passed away at the Gonoshasthaya Nagar Hospital in the capital last night.\n",
      " He was 81.\n",
      "  Dr Zafrullah, the recipient of Swadhinata Padak, the highest civilian award of Bangladesh, was taken to the hospital in Dhanmondi after he fell seriously ill on April 5.\n",
      "  Prof Brig Gen (retd) Mamun Mostafi, who led the medical board formed for Zafrullah's treatment, declared his death at 11:00pm.\n",
      "  Zafrullah was suffering various health complications with dysfunctional immune system leading to many infections, Mohibullah Khondoker, vice-principal of Gonoshasthaya Samaj Vittik Medical College, told The Daily Star.\n",
      "  Doctors said his liver and kidneys suffered much since he was infected with Covid-19. Zafrullah was alive with almost two dysfunctional kidneys and had to go through dialysis thrice a week.\n",
      "  On April 7, a medical board, led by Mamun, was formed with the renowned doctors of the country for his treatment. On April 10, he was put on life support.\n",
      "  Defying his fragile health, Zafrullah remained active -- participating in seminars, and political and social events. His condition worsened several times, yet he bounced back.\n",
      "  But this time this brave man lost the battle.\n",
      "  Born in Raozan upazila of Chattogram on December 27, 1941, Zafrullah was the eldest among 10 siblings. He passed matriculation from Nabakumar Institution in the capital's Bakshibazar and intermediate exams from Dhaka College.\n",
      "  He completed MBBS from Dhaka Medical College in 1964 and went to London to study FRCS. When the four-year FRCS course was about to be completed, the Liberation War broke out in Bangladesh.\n",
      "  He chose to abort the exams and dedicated himself in mobilising the people for the independence of the nation, setting an example of unparalleled patriotism.\n",
      "  Zafrullah also tore apart the Pakistani passport during a rally in London, protesting the massacre of Bangalees by the Pakistan occupation army. In May 1971, without any passport, Zafrullah and Dr MA Mobin decided to fly to Kolkata.\n",
      "  They collected travel permits and started for Kolkata on a Syrian Airlines flight. Damuscus was their stopover. The Pakistan government was watching their every step and tried to arrest them with the help of the Syrian government.\n",
      "  All the passengers left the aircraft. However, sensing the danger, the duo did not move as they knew the police cannot arrest anyone from an international flight.\n",
      "  At the end of May, they reached Agartola. There, he built Bangladesh Field Hospital, which primarily took shape in Bisramganj village of Agartola, India.\n",
      "  It was the seed of Gonoshasthaya Kendra, which would revolutionise the public health sector after independence.\n",
      "  During the war, freedom fighters wounded in battle were treated in that field hospital -- a structure made of bamboo and grass that had 480 beds and an operation theatre.\n",
      "  Zafrullah and Mobin provided paramedical training to a group of volunteers who worked as nurses for the hospital.\n",
      "  In a heavily conservative society, Zafrullah took the challenge to break the stereotype by empowering women and engaging them in his workforce.\n",
      "  The total number of staffers at the Gonoshasthaya Kendra is now around 2,500. Of them, 40 percent are women.\n",
      "  Zafrullah's most remarkable contribution after the Liberation War was formulating the drug policy that served as a cornerstone of today's robust pharmaceutical industry..\n",

      "Jaime Silva from the Philippine Foundation for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled, Inc., Marlo Lucas from the Resources for the Blind Inc. , and Jayme Marino of the National Council on Disability Affairs . Also present during the launch are Dr. Florencio Costa of the Tanza National Comprehensive High School Mr. Joebert Guzon of FEAPITSAT , and Coralyn Perez of Tanza Municipal Social Welfare and Development representing Mayor Yuri Pacumio\n",
      "  “The Blackout Zone” is the first exhibit simulating the blind experience in the Philippines which is mounted inside a mall, promising an immersive and experiential tour of a day in the life of a blind person for free. Participants get to fulfill simple tasks, like tying a shoe, creating a sandwich, making coffee, and watching movies in a safe setting without sight. At the end of the tour, the participants are debriefed by the blind master, a representative of the blind community who shares their personal insights and how the challenges within the exhibit reflect the daily experience of blind people. In this way, mall-goers, tenants, and employees are encouraged to have a deeper understanding and affection for members of the blind community.\n",
      "  “ We at SM Cares firmly believe that empathy and awareness are crucial to enabling a barrier-free and disability inclusive environment ,” said Mateo during the launch. “ As such, we humbly invite everyone to visit ‘The Blackout Zone' to show solidarity, appreciation, and inspired action to the blind community .”\n",
      "  Following the success of “The Blackout Zone” from previous legs in SM Southmall and SM City Clark, SM City Tanza's setup is the biggest one to date. First launched in October of last year, “The Blackout Zone” has been visited by almost 2,000 attendees. The Tanza exhibit will be open until May 14, and plans for future exhibits in different SM malls around the country are already underway.\n",
      "  The Blackout Zone is just one of the many initiatives of SM Cares under its Program on Persons with Disabilities. Others include the annual Emergency Preparedness Forum for PWDs and senior citizens; the annual Happy Walk for Down Syndrome in partnership with the Down Syndrome Association of the Philippines; and the annual Angels Walk for Autism in partnership with Autism Society Philippines.\n",
      "  Through The Blackout Zone, SM Cares supports the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly “SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities.”\n",
      "  SM Cares is the corporate social responsibility arm of SM Supermalls, supporting initiatives focused on communities and the environment. Aside from the program on PWDs, its advocacies include Programs for the Environment, Women & Breastfeeding Mothers, Children & Youth, Senior Citizens, and the SM Bike-friendly initiative.\n",
